## <mark> 2) List out various operators in python. Explain any one with a suitable example. </mark>

### Various Operators in Python

Python provides a rich set of operators that allow you to perform various operations on variables and values. The main categories of operators in Python include:

#### 1. **Arithmetic Operators**

- `+` : Addition
- `-` : Subtraction
- `*` : Multiplication
- `/` : Division
- `//` : Floor Division
- `%` : Modulus
- `*` : Exponentiation

#### 2. **Comparison Operators**

- `==` : Equal to
- `!=` : Not equal to
- `>` : Greater than
- `<` : Less than
- `>=` : Greater than or equal to
- `<=` : Less than or equal to

#### 3. **Logical Operators**

- `and` : Logical AND
- `or` : Logical OR
- `not` : Logical NOT

#### 4. **Bitwise Operators**

- `&` : Bitwise AND
- `|` : Bitwise OR
- `^` : Bitwise XOR
- `~` : Bitwise NOT
- `<<` : Left Shift
- `>>` : Right Shift

#### 5. **Assignment Operators**

- `=` : Assigns value from right side to left side
- `+=` : Add and assign
- `=` : Subtract and assign
- `=` : Multiply and assign
- `/=` : Divide and assign
- `%=` : Modulus and assign

#### 6. **Identity Operators**

- `is` : Checks if two variables point to the same object
- `is not` : Checks if two variables do not point to the same object

#### 7. **Membership Operators**

- `in` : Checks if a value is present in a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string)
- `not in` : Checks if a value is not present in a sequence

#### Example: Arithmetic Operator

Letâ€™s explore the **addition operator (`+`)** with an example.

#### Example of Addition Operator

```python
## Define two numbers
a = 10
b = 5

## Use the addition operator to add the two numbers
result = a + b

## Print the result
print("The sum of", a, "and", b, "is:", result)

```

#### Explanation:

In this example:

1. We define two variables, `a` and `b`, with values 10 and 5 respectively.
2. We use the addition operator (`+`) to add these two numbers and store the result in the variable named `result`.
3. Finally, we print the result using the print function.

When you run this code, it will output:

```
The sum of 10 and 5 is: 15

```

This demonstrates how straightforward it is to use operators in Python to perform basic arithmetic operations.

## <mark> 3) Explain Identity and Membership Operator with an example(is , is not ,in , not in). </mark>

### Identity and Membership Operators

Python provides two types of operators related to object identity and membership:

#### Identity Operators

The identity operators `is` and `is not` are used to check if two variables refer to the same object in memory.

- `is` evaluates to `True` if the operands are the same object, `False` otherwise.
- `is not` evaluates to `True` if the operands are not the same object, `False` otherwise.

Example:

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
c = [1, 2, 3]

print(a is b)  ## True, a and b refer to the same list object
print(a is c)  ## False, a and c refer to different list objects
print(a is not c)  ## True, a and c are not the same object

```

#### Membership Operators

The membership operators `in` and `not in` are used to test if a value is present in a sequence (string, list, tuple, set, dictionary).

- `in` evaluates to `True` if the value is present in the sequence, `False` otherwise.
- `not in` evaluates to `True` if the value is not present in the sequence, `False` otherwise.

Example:

```python
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']

print('red' in colors)   ## True, 'red' is present in the list
print('yellow' in colors)  ## False, 'yellow' is not present in the list
print('yellow' not in colors)  ## True, 'yellow' is not in the list

```

In the first example, we create two lists `a` and `c` with the same elements. However, `a` and `b` refer to the same list object in memory, while `a` and `c` refer to different objects. The `is` operator correctly identifies that `a` and `b` are the same object, but `a` and `c` are not.

In the second example, we check if the string values are present in the `colors` list using the `in` and `not in` operators. The membership operators allow us to easily test if a value is contained within a sequence.

The identity operators are useful for comparing object references, while the membership operators are helpful for checking if a value exists in a sequence.

## <mark> 4) Explain the input function of python that demonstrates type casting. </mark>

### The `input()` Function and Type Casting in Python

The `input()` function in Python allows users to provide input during program execution. By default, the `input()` function returns the user input as a string. However, in many cases, you may want to convert the input to a specific data type, such as an integer or float. This process is called type casting.

Here's an example demonstrating the `input()` function and type casting:

```python
## Prompt the user for input
name = input("What is your name? ")

## Print the input
print("Hello,", name)

## Prompt the user for an integer
age = int(input("What is your age? "))

## Print the age
print("You are", age, "years old.")

## Prompt the user for a float
height = float(input("What is your height in meters? "))

## Print the height
print("Your height is", height, "meters.")

```

In this example:

1. The `input()` function is used to prompt the user for their name, and the input is stored in the variable `name`. Since no type casting is performed, `name` will be a string.
2. The `print()` function is used to display a greeting with the user's name.
3. The `input()` function is used again to prompt the user for their age. However, this time, the `int()` function is used to convert the input string to an integer. The result is stored in the variable `age`.
4. The `print()` function is used to display the user's age.
5. The `input()` function is used once more to prompt the user for their height in meters. The `float()` function is used to convert the input string to a floating-point number. The result is stored in the variable `height`.
6. The `print()` function is used to display the user's height.

When you run this program, it will prompt the user for their name, age, and height, and then display the input values with appropriate greetings.

Here's an example of how the program might run:

```
What is your name? John
Hello, John
What is your age? 25
You are 25 years old.
What is your height in meters? 1.75
Your height is 1.75 meters.

```

In this example, the user input is:

- Name: John
- Age: 25
- Height: 1.75

The `input()` function always returns a string, so it's important to convert the input to the desired data type using functions like `int()` or `float()` if you want to perform arithmetic operations or comparisons with the input values.

## <mark> 5) Explain the following data structures of python with suitable examples. </mark>

a. Set
b. List
c. Tuple
d. Dictionary

### Data Structures in Python

Python provides several built-in data structures that allow you to store and manipulate collections of data. The most commonly used data structures include Sets, Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries. Below is a detailed explanation of each, along with suitable examples.

#### a. Set

A **Set** is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are mutable, meaning you can add or remove items after the set has been created. However, they do not support indexing or slicing.

#### Example:

```python
## Creating a set
fruits = {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}

## Adding an element
fruits.add('orange')
print(fruits)  ## Output: {'banana', 'cherry', 'apple', 'orange'}

## Removing an element
fruits.remove('banana')
print(fruits)  ## Output: {'cherry', 'apple', 'orange'}

## Checking membership
print('apple' in fruits)  ## Output: True

```

#### b. List

A **List** is an ordered collection of items that can be of different types. Lists are mutable, allowing you to modify them after their creation. They support indexing and slicing.

#### Example:

```python
## Creating a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

## Adding an element
numbers.append(6)
print(numbers)  ## Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

## Removing an element
numbers.remove(3)
print(numbers)  ## Output: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]

## Accessing elements by index
print(numbers[0])  ## Output: 1

```

#### c. Tuple

A **Tuple** is similar to a list but is immutable, meaning once it is created, you cannot modify it (i.e., you cannot add or remove items). Tuples are ordered collections and support indexing.

#### Example:

```python
## Creating a tuple
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)

## Accessing elements by index
print(coordinates[0])  ## Output: 10.0

## Attempting to modify a tuple (will raise an error)
## coordinates[0] = 15.0  ## TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

## Tuples can contain different data types
mixed_tuple = (1, "Hello", 3.14)
print(mixed_tuple)  ## Output: (1, 'Hello', 3.14)

```

#### d. Dictionary

A **Dictionary** is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Keys must be unique and immutable (strings, numbers, or tuples), while values can be of any type and can be duplicated. Dictionaries are mutable.

#### Example:

```python
## Creating a dictionary
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

## Accessing values by key
print(person["name"])  ## Output: Alice

## Adding a new key-value pair
person["email"] = "alice@example.com"
print(person)
## Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York', 'email': 'alice@example.com'}

## Removing a key-value pair
del person["age"]
print(person)
## Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'city': 'New York', 'email': 'alice@example.com'}

```

### Summary

- **Set**: Unordered collection of unique elements; mutable.
- **List**: Ordered collection of items; mutable and supports indexing.
- **Tuple**: Ordered collection of items; immutable.
- **Dictionary**: Unordered collection of key-value pairs; mutable.

These data structures provide flexibility and efficiency when handling different types of data in Python programming.

```

These examples demonstrate the basic operations available for strings, tuples, lists, and dictionaries in Python. They are fundamental data structures used in various programming tasks.

## <mark> 7) Differentiate List and Tuple in Python. </mark>

### Differentiating List and Tuple in Python

Both lists and tuples are built-in data structures in Python that are used to store collections of items. However, they have distinct characteristics and use cases. Below is a comparison highlighting their key differences:

#### 1. **Mutability**

- **List**: Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content (add, remove, or modify elements) after the list has been created.
- **Tuple**: Tuples are immutable, meaning once a tuple is created, you cannot change its content.

**Example**:

```python
## List example
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list[0] = 10  ## Modifying the first element
print(my_list)  ## Output: [10, 2, 3]

## Tuple example
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
## my_tuple[0] = 10  ## This will raise a TypeError

```

#### 2. **Syntax**

- **List**: Lists are defined using square brackets `[]`.
- **Tuple**: Tuples are defined using parentheses `()`.

**Example**:

```python
## List
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

## Tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)

```

#### 3. **Performance**

- **List**: Lists have a higher overhead due to their mutability. They require more memory and may be slower for certain operations compared to tuples.
- **Tuple**: Tuples are generally faster than lists for iteration and have a smaller memory footprint because they are immutable.

#### 4. **Use Cases**

- **List**: Lists are used when you need a collection of items that may change during the program execution (e.g., dynamic data).
- **Tuple**: Tuples are used when you want to ensure that the collection of items remains constant throughout the program (e.g., fixed data).

#### 5. **Methods**

- **List**: Lists have many built-in methods such as `append()`, `remove()`, `sort()`, etc., that allow for various operations.
- **Tuple**: Tuples have fewer built-in methods; primarily `count()` and `index()`.

**Example**:

```python
## List methods
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)          ## Adding an element
print(my_list)             ## Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

## Tuple methods
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(my_tuple.count(2))   ## Output: 1
print(my_tuple.index(3))    ## Output: 2

```

#### Summary Table

| Feature     | List                      | Tuple                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Mutability  | Mutable                   | Immutable                  |
| Syntax      | Square brackets `[]`      | Parentheses `()`           |
| Performance | Slower due to mutability  | Faster due to immutability |
| Use Cases   | Dynamic data              | Fixed data                 |
| Methods     | Many (e.g., append, sort) | Few (e.g., count, index)   |

In conclusion, while both lists and tuples serve the purpose of storing collections of items in Python, their differences in mutability, syntax, performance, and use cases make them suitable for different scenarios. Lists are preferable when you need a dynamic collection that can be modified, while tuples are ideal for fixed collections where immutability is desired.

## <mark> 8) Is String a mutable data type? Also explain the string operations length, indexing and slicing in detail with an appropriate example. OR Explain strings and operations on string type. (slicing, indexing, stride, etc..) </mark>

### Are Strings Mutable in Python?

Strings in Python are **immutable**, which means once a string is created, it cannot be modified. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string. This immutability is a key characteristic that differentiates strings from other data types like lists, which are mutable.

### String Operations

#### 1. Length

The length of a string can be determined using the built-in `len()` function, which returns the number of characters in the string.

#### Example:

```python
text = "Hello, World!"
length = len(text)
print("Length of the string:", length)  ## Output: Length of the string: 13

```

#### 2. Indexing

Indexing allows you to access individual characters in a string. Python uses zero-based indexing, meaning the first character is at index 0.

#### Example:

```python
text = "Python"
first_character = text[0]   ## Accessing the first character
last_character = text[-1]    ## Accessing the last character
print("First character:", first_character)  ## Output: First character: P
print("Last character:", last_character)    ## Output: Last character: n

```

#### 3. Slicing

Slicing enables you to extract a substring from a string by specifying a start index and an end index. The slice will include characters from the start index up to, but not including, the end index.

#### Example:

```python
text = "Programming"
substring = text[0:4]  ## Extracting characters from index 0 to 3
print("Substring:", substring)  ## Output: Substring: Prog

## You can also omit the start or end index
substring_from_start = text[:4]   ## From start to index 3
substring_to_end = text[4:]        ## From index 4 to end

print("Substring from start:", substring_from_start)  ## Output: Substring from start: Prog
print("Substring to end:", substring_to_end)          ## Output: Substring to end: ramming

```

#### 4. Stride

In addition to slicing, Python allows you to specify a stride (step) in your slice notation. The syntax for slicing is `string[start:end:step]`, where `step` determines how many characters to skip.

#### Example:

```python
text = "Hello, World!"
## Extract every second character from index 0 to 12
sliced_with_stride = text[0:12:2]
print("Sliced with stride:", sliced_with_stride)  ## Output: Sliced with stride: Hlo ol!

```

#### Summary of String Operations

- **Length**: Use `len()` to get the number of characters in a string.
- **Indexing**: Access individual characters using square brackets `[]`.
- **Slicing**: Extract substrings using `string[start:end]`.
- **Stride**: Use `string[start:end:step]` to control the step size while slicing.

These operations provide powerful ways to manipulate and analyze strings in Python, making it easy to work with textual data effectively.

## <mark> 9) Explain branching in the context of python. (if, else, else..if,break) </mark>

### Branching in Python

Branching allows your program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. Python provides several statements for branching:

1. **`if`** statement
2. **`if-else`** statement
3. **`if-elif-else`** statement
4. **`break`** statement

Let's discuss each of them in detail.

#### 1. **`if`** statement

The **`if`** statement is used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true. The general syntax is:

```python
if condition:
    ## code block

```

Here, the code block will only be executed if the `condition` evaluates to `True`.

Example:

```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")

```

Output:

```
You are an adult.

```

#### 2. **`if-else`** statement

The **`if-else`** statement is used to execute one block of code if a condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false. The general syntax is:

```python
if condition:
    ## code block if condition is true
else:
    ## code block if condition is false

```

Example:

```python
age = 16
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")

```

Output:

```
You are a minor.

```

#### 3. **`if-elif-else`** statement

The **`if-elif-else`** statement is used when you have multiple conditions to check. It allows you to execute different blocks of code based on different conditions. The general syntax is:

```python
if condition1:
    ## code block if condition1 is true
elif condition2:
    ## code block if condition2 is true
...
else:
    ## code block if all conditions are false

```

Example:

```python
score = 85
if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: F")

```

Output:

```
Grade: B

```

#### 4. **`break`** statement

The **`break`** statement is used to exit a loop (such as **`for`** or **`while`**) prematurely. It is often used inside an **`if`** statement within a loop. When the **`break`** statement is executed, the loop terminates immediately, and the program continues with the next statement outside the loop.

Example:

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)

```

Output:

```
1
2

```

In this example, the loop stops when `i` becomes 3 because of the **`break`** statement.

Branching statements allow your Python program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on specific conditions. They are essential for creating programs with dynamic behavior.

## <mark> 10) Discuss control structure in context of python. (for, while) </mark>

### Control Structures in Python: Loops

Control structures are essential for managing the flow of execution in a program. In Python, loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. The two primary types of loops in Python are **`for`** loops and **`while`** loops. Below is a detailed explanation of each type, along with examples.

#### 1. **`for` Loop**

The **`for`** loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range). It allows you to execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.

#### Syntax:

```python
for variable in sequence:
    ## code block

```

#### Example:

```python
## Using a for loop to iterate through a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

```

**Output:**

```
apple
banana
cherry

```

You can also use the `range()` function with `for` loops to repeat actions a specific number of times.

#### Example with `range()`:

```python
## Using range to repeat an action multiple times
for i in range(5):
    print("Iteration:", i)

```

**Output:**

```
Iteration: 0
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Iteration: 3
Iteration: 4

```

#### 2. **`while` Loop**

The **`while`** loop continues to execute as long as a specified condition is true. It is useful when you do not know beforehand how many iterations you will need.

#### Syntax:

```python
while condition:
    ## code block

```

#### Example:

```python
## Using a while loop to count down from 5 to 1
count = 5
while count > 0:
    print("Countdown:", count)
    count -= 1  ## Decrement the count by 1

```

**Output:**

```
Countdown: 5
Countdown: 4
Countdown: 3
Countdown: 2
Countdown: 1

```

#### Break Statement

Both `for` and `while` loops can be terminated prematurely using the **`break`** statement. This is useful when you want to exit the loop based on a certain condition.

#### Example:

```python
## Using break to exit a loop early
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break  ## Exit the loop when i equals 5
    print(i)

```

**Output:**

```
0
1
2
3
4

```

#### Summary

- **`for` Loop**: Iterates over elements of a sequence (like lists, tuples, or strings) or through a range of numbers.
- **`while` Loop**: Repeats as long as a specified condition is true.
- **Break Statement**: Allows for premature termination of loops.

These control structures are fundamental for implementing repetitive tasks and managing the flow of execution in your Python programs. Understanding how to use them effectively can significantly enhance your programming capabilities.

## <mark> 11) What are User Defined Functions in python? Explain with examples. </mark>

### User-Defined Functions in Python

User-defined functions in Python are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They allow you to encapsulate logic, making your code more organized, modular, and easier to maintain. Functions can take inputs, perform operations, and return outputs.

#### Defining a Function

To define a function in Python, you use the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses containing any parameters. The function body is indented below the definition.

#### Syntax:

```python
def function_name(parameters):
    ## code block
    return value  ## optional

```

#### Example of a Simple Function

Hereâ€™s a simple example of a user-defined function that adds two numbers:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result

## Calling the function
sum_result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print("The sum is:", sum_result)  ## Output: The sum is: 8

```

#### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `add_numbers` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.
2. **Function Body**: Inside the function, it calculates the sum of `a` and `b` and stores it in the variable `result`.
3. **Return Statement**: The function returns the result.
4. **Function Call**: The function is called with arguments `5` and `3`, and the output is printed.

#### Example with Default Parameters

You can also define functions with default parameter values:

```python
def greet(name="Guest"):
    print("Hello,", name)

## Calling the function without an argument
greet()  ## Output: Hello, Guest

## Calling the function with an argument
greet("Alice")  ## Output: Hello, Alice

```

#### Example with Variable Number of Arguments

Python allows you to define functions that accept a variable number of arguments using `*args` for non-keyword arguments and `**kwargs` for keyword arguments.

```python
def print_scores(*scores):
    for score in scores:
        print(score)

## Calling the function with multiple arguments
print_scores(90, 85, 78)
## Output:
## 90
## 85
## 78

def print_info(**info):
    for key, value in info.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

## Calling the function with keyword arguments
print_info(name="John", age=25)
## Output:
## name: John
## age: 25

```

#### Recursive Functions

A recursive function is one that calls itself. This can be useful for tasks like calculating factorials or traversing data structures.

#### Example:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

## Calling the recursive function
result = factorial(5)
print("Factorial of 5 is:", result)  ## Output: Factorial of 5 is: 120

```

#### Summary

- **Definition**: User-defined functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.
- **Parameters**: Functions can take parameters and return values.
- **Default Parameters**: You can set default values for parameters.
- **Variable Arguments**: Use `args` and `*kwargs` to handle variable numbers of arguments.
- **Recursion**: Functions can call themselves to solve problems recursively.

User-defined functions enhance code readability and reusability, making them an essential feature in Python programming.

## <mark> 12) Explain various types of Argument passing methods in python programming each with appropriate Arguments/Keyword Arguments/Default examples. Arguments/Variable (Positional length arguments) </mark>

In Python, functions can accept arguments in various ways, allowing for flexibility and adaptability in how data is passed to functions. Below are the different types of argument passing methods, including positional arguments, keyword arguments, default arguments, and variable-length arguments.

#### 1. Positional Arguments

Positional arguments are the most common type of argument. They are passed to the function in the order they are defined. The first argument corresponds to the first parameter, the second to the second parameter, and so on.

#### Example:

```python
def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

## Calling the function with positional arguments
result = multiply(4, 5)
print("Result of multiplication:", result)  ## Output: Result of multiplication: 20

```

#### 2. Keyword Arguments

Keyword arguments allow you to pass arguments by explicitly naming each parameter. This makes it clear what value is being assigned to which parameter and allows you to change the order of the arguments.

#### Example:

```python
def introduce(name, age):
    print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")

## Calling the function with keyword arguments
introduce(age=25, name="Alice")
## Output: My name is Alice and I am 25 years old.

```

#### 3. Default Arguments

Default arguments allow you to define default values for parameters. If a value for that parameter is not provided during the function call, the default value is used.

#### Example:

```python
def greet(name="Guest"):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

## Calling the function without providing an argument
greet()  ## Output: Hello, Guest!

## Calling the function with an argument
greet("Bob")  ## Output: Hello, Bob!

```

#### 4. Variable-Length Arguments

Python allows you to pass a variable number of arguments to a function using `*args` for non-keyword variable-length arguments and `**kwargs` for keyword variable-length arguments.

#### Example with `args`:

```python
def add_numbers(*args):
    return sum(args)

## Calling the function with a variable number of positional arguments
result = add_numbers(1, 2, 3, 4)
print("Sum of numbers:", result)  ## Output: Sum of numbers: 10

```

#### Example with `*kwargs`:

```python
def display_info(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

## Calling the function with keyword arguments
display_info(name="Alice", age=25, city="New York")
## Output:
## name: Alice
## age: 25
## city: New York

```

#### Summary of Argument Passing Methods

| Argument Type        | Description                                                                                  | Example                           |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Positional Arguments | Passed in order; must match the function definition.                                         | `multiply(4, 5)`                  |
| Keyword Arguments    | Passed by explicitly naming each parameter; allows changing order.                           | `introduce(name="Alice", age=25)` |
| Default Arguments    | Parameters can have default values; used if no value is provided during the call.            | `greet(name="Bob")`               |
| Variable-Length Args | Allows passing a variable number of non-keyword (`*args`) or keyword (`**kwargs`) arguments. | `add_numbers(1, 2, 3)`            |

These argument passing methods provide flexibility when defining functions in Python and allow for more readable and maintainable code.

## <mark> 13) Explain pass by value and pass by reference in python with appropriate example. </mark>

### Pass by Value and Pass by Reference in Python

In programming, the terms **pass by value** and **pass by reference** refer to how arguments are passed to functions. Understanding these concepts is crucial for managing how data is handled in your programs.

#### Pass by Value

**Pass by value** means that a copy of the actual value is passed to the function. This means that changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable outside the function.

#### Example of Pass by Value:

```python
def modify_value(x):
    x = x + 10  ## This modifies the local copy
    print("Inside function:", x)

num = 5
modify_value(num)
print("Outside function:", num)  ## Original value remains unchanged

```

**Output:**

```
Inside function: 15
Outside function: 5

```

In this example, the variable `num` retains its original value because only a copy of `num` was modified inside the `modify_value` function.

#### Pass by Reference

**Pass by reference** means that a reference to the actual object is passed to the function. This allows changes made to the parameter inside the function to affect the original object outside the function. In Python, all mutable objects (like lists and dictionaries) are passed by reference, while immutable objects (like integers and strings) are effectively passed by value.

#### Example of Pass by Reference with Mutable Object:

```python
def modify_list(lst):
    lst.append(4)  ## This modifies the original list

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
modify_list(my_list)
print("After modification:", my_list)  ## Original list is modified

```

**Output:**

```
After modification: [1, 2, 3, 4]

```

In this case, since `my_list` is a mutable object (a list), it gets modified directly when passed to the `modify_list` function.

#### Example of Pass by Reference with Immutable Object:

```python
def modify_string(s):
    s += " World!"  ## This creates a new string object

my_string = "Hello"
modify_string(my_string)
print("After modification:", my_string)  ## Original string remains unchanged

```

**Output:**

```
After modification: Hello

```

In this case, even though strings are technically passed by reference, they are immutable. The operation inside `modify_string` creates a new string rather than modifying the original.

#### Summary

- **Pass by Value**: A copy of the variable's value is passed to the function. Changes made inside the function do not affect the original variable.
- **Pass by Reference**: A reference to the actual object is passed to the function. Changes made inside the function can affect the original object if it is mutable.
- In Python:
  - Immutable types (like integers, strings, and tuples) behave like pass-by-value.
  - Mutable types (like lists and dictionaries) behave like pass-by-reference.

Understanding these concepts helps in predicting how data will be affected when passed into functions, leading to better code management and fewer bugs.

## <mark> 14) Discuss function scope in python with sample code.(local/Global) </mark>

### Function Scope in Python

In Python, the scope of a variable refers to the region of the program where that variable is accessible. There are two primary types of scope: **local scope** and **global scope**.

#### 1. Local Scope

A variable defined inside a function has a local scope. This means that the variable is only accessible within that function and cannot be accessed from outside it. Local variables are created when the function is called and destroyed when the function exits.

#### Example of Local Scope:

```python
def my_function():
    local_var = "I am local"
    print(local_var)  ## This will print the local variable

my_function()
## Output: I am local

## Trying to access the local variable outside the function will raise an error
## print(local_var)  ## Uncommenting this line will raise NameError

```

#### 2. Global Scope

A variable defined outside of any function has a global scope. This means that it can be accessed from any part of the program, including inside functions. However, if you want to modify a global variable inside a function, you need to declare it as `global`.

#### Example of Global Scope:

```python
global_var = "I am global"

def another_function():
    print(global_var)  ## This will access the global variable

another_function()
## Output: I am global

```

#### Modifying Global Variables

To modify a global variable within a function, you must use the `global` keyword.

#### Example of Modifying a Global Variable:

```python
counter = 0  ## Global variable

def increment_counter():
    global counter  ## Declare counter as global
    counter += 1    ## Modify the global variable

increment_counter()
print("Counter after increment:", counter)  ## Output: Counter after increment: 1

```

#### Summary of Variable Scopes

- **Local Variables**: Defined within a function; only accessible within that function.
- **Global Variables**: Defined outside any function; accessible throughout the program.
- **Using `global` Keyword**: Required to modify a global variable inside a function.

Understanding variable scope is crucial for managing data and ensuring that your functions behave as expected in Python programs. It helps prevent naming conflicts and makes your code more organized and easier to debug.

## <mark> 15) Explain the concept of recursion in python with suitable examples. </mark>

### Recursion in Python

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It is particularly useful for tasks that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems. A recursive function typically has two main components:

1. **Base Case**: A condition under which the function returns a value without making any further recursive calls. This prevents infinite recursion and eventually stops the recursion.
2. **Recursive Case**: The part of the function where the function calls itself with modified arguments, moving towards the base case.

#### Example of Recursion: Factorial Function

One of the classic examples of recursion is calculating the factorial of a number. The factorial of a non-negative integer $n$ (denoted as $n!$ ) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$ . The factorial can be defined recursively as follows:

- **Base Case**: $0! = 1$
- **Recursive Case**: $n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

#### Implementation:

```python
def factorial(n):
    ## Base case
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        ## Recursive case
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

## Testing the factorial function
print(factorial(5))  ## Output: 120
print(factorial(0))  ## Output: 1

```

#### Explanation:

1. **Base Case**: When `n` is `0`, the function returns `1`.
2. **Recursive Case**: For any other positive integer `n`, the function calls itself with `n - 1` and multiplies the result by `n`.

#### Example of Recursion: Fibonacci Sequence

Another common example of recursion is calculating numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

- **Base Cases**:
  - $F(0) = 0$
  - $F(1) = 1$
- **Recursive Case**: $F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)$

#### Implementation:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    ## Base cases
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        ## Recursive case
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

## Testing the fibonacci function
print(fibonacci(5))  ## Output: 5 (The sequence is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5)
print(fibonacci(10)) ## Output: 55

```

#### Explanation:

1. **Base Cases**: When `n` is `0`, it returns `0`, and when `n` is `1`, it returns `1`.
2. **Recursive Case**: For any other value of `n`, it calculates Fibonacci by summing up the results of the two previous Fibonacci numbers.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages of Recursion

#### Advantages:

- **Simplicity**: Recursive solutions can be more straightforward and easier to understand than their iterative counterparts.
- **Natural Fit for Certain Problems**: Problems like tree traversals, combinatorial problems, and problems that can be divided into smaller subproblems are naturally suited for recursion.

#### Disadvantages:

- **Performance**: Recursive functions can lead to high memory usage due to maintaining multiple function calls on the call stack.
- **Risk of Infinite Recursion**: If a base case is not defined correctly or if thereâ€™s an error in logic, it can lead to infinite recursion and eventually cause a stack overflow error.

#### Conclusion

Recursion is a powerful concept in Python that allows functions to call themselves to solve problems. By understanding how to define base cases and recursive cases, you can effectively use recursion for various computational tasks. However, it's essential to be mindful of its potential drawbacks regarding performance and memory usage.

## <mark> 16) Explain different types of python modules. How are modules used in Python? Explain creation of user defined modules in python with a suitable example. </mark>

### Python Modules

In Python, a **module** is a file containing Python code that can define functions, classes, and variables. It allows you to organize your code into manageable sections. Modules can be built-in (provided by Python) or user-defined (created by the user).

#### Types of Python Modules

1. **Built-in Modules**: These are modules that come with Python's standard library. Examples include:
   - `math`: Provides mathematical functions.
   - `os`: Provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
   - `sys`: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions.
2. **Third-Party Modules**: These are modules created by the community and can be installed using package managers like `pip`. Examples include:
   - `numpy`: A library for numerical computations.
   - `pandas`: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
   - `requests`: A library for making HTTP requests.
3. **User-Defined Modules**: These are custom modules created by the user to encapsulate specific functionality.

#### How Modules Are Used in Python

Modules are used to:

- Organize code logically.
- Reuse code across different programs.
- Avoid code duplication.
- Improve maintainability.

You can use a module in your program by importing it using the `import` statement.

#### Example of Importing a Module:

```python
import math

## Using the math module
result = math.sqrt(16)
print("Square root of 16 is:", result)  ## Output: Square root of 16 is: 4.0

```

#### Creation of User-Defined Modules

Creating a user-defined module in Python is simple. You just need to create a `.py` file containing your functions, classes, or variables, and then you can import it into other scripts.

#### Steps to Create a User-Defined Module:

1. **Create a Python File**: Create a file named `my_module.py`.

```python
## my_module.py

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

```

1. **Use the Module in Another Script**: You can import and use the functions defined in `my_module.py` from another script.

```python
## main.py

## Importing the user-defined module
import my_module

## Using functions from the module
greeting = my_module.greet("Alice")
print(greeting)  ## Output: Hello, Alice!

sum_result = my_module.add(5, 3)
print("Sum:", sum_result)  ## Output: Sum: 8

```

#### Summary

- **Modules** help organize code into reusable components.
- **Types of modules** include built-in modules, third-party modules, and user-defined modules.
- You can create user-defined modules by writing functions or classes in a `.py` file and importing them into other scripts using the `import` statement.

This modular approach enhances code readability, maintainability, and reusability in Python programming.

## <mark> 17) Explain any 4 built in modules in Python programming. </mark>

Python provides a rich set of built-in modules that facilitate various functionalities, from mathematical operations to file handling and system interactions. Here are four commonly used built-in modules in Python:

#### 1. `math` Module

The `math` module provides access to mathematical functions defined by the C standard. It includes functions for basic arithmetic, logarithmic calculations, trigonometry, and more.

#### Example:

```python
import math

## Using math functions
number = 16
sqrt_value = math.sqrt(number)  ## Square root
log_value = math.log10(number)   ## Base 10 logarithm

print(f"Square root of {number} is: {sqrt_value}")  ## Output: 4.0
print(f"Log base 10 of {number} is: {log_value}")    ## Output: 1.204119982655921

```

#### 2. `os` Module

The `os` module provides a way to use operating system-dependent functionality like reading or writing to the file system and interacting with the environment.

#### Example:

```python
import os

## Get the current working directory
current_directory = os.getcwd()
print("Current Directory:", current_directory)

## List files in the current directory
files = os.listdir(current_directory)
print("Files in Current Directory:", files)

```

#### 3. `sys` Module

The `sys` module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter and to functions that interact with the interpreter. It is commonly used for command-line arguments and manipulating the Python runtime environment.

#### Example:

```python
import sys

## Print command line arguments
print("Command Line Arguments:", sys.argv)

## Print Python version
print("Python Version:", sys.version)

```

#### 4. `random` Module

The `random` module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions. It can be used to generate random numbers, select random elements from a list, shuffle sequences, etc.

#### Example:

```python
import random

## Generate a random integer between 1 and 10
random_integer = random.randint(1, 10)
print("Random Integer:", random_integer)

## Select a random element from a list
choices = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
random_choice = random.choice(choices)
print("Random Choice:", random_choice)

## Shuffle a list
random.shuffle(choices)
print("Shuffled List:", choices)

```

#### Summary

- **`math`**: Provides mathematical functions like square root and logarithms.
- **`os`**: Allows interaction with the operating system (e.g., file handling).
- **`sys`**: Provides access to interpreter variables and command-line arguments.
- **`random`**: Implements pseudo-random number generation and selection.

These built-in modules enhance Python's capabilities, making it easier to perform complex tasks with minimal code. You can import these modules and use their functions as demonstrated in the examples above.

## <mark> 18) Describe the concept of mutability in Python. Compare mutability of strings, tuples, lists, sets, and dictionaries. </mark>

In Python, mutability refers to the ability to change an object after it has been created. Some objects are mutable, meaning their internal state can be modified, while others are immutable, meaning their state cannot be changed once created.

Here's a comparison of mutability for different data types in Python:

1. **Strings**:
   - Strings are immutable. Once a string is created, its individual characters cannot be modified.
   - Operations like concatenation or slicing create a new string object rather than modifying the original.
2. **Tuples**:
   - Tuples are immutable. The elements of a tuple cannot be changed after it is created.
   - However, if a tuple contains mutable objects like lists, those objects can be modified internally.
3. **Lists**:
   - Lists are mutable. Elements of a list can be added, removed, or modified after the list is created.
   - List methods like `append()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, and `pop()` allow modifying the list in-place.
4. **Sets**:
   - Sets are mutable. Elements can be added or removed from a set after it is created.
   - Set methods like `add()`, `discard()`, and `remove()` allow modifying the set in-place.
5. **Dictionaries**:
   - Dictionaries are mutable. Key-value pairs can be added, modified, or removed from a dictionary after it is created.
   - Dictionary methods like `update()` and `pop()` allow modifying the dictionary in-place.

In summary:

- Strings and tuples are immutable, while lists, sets, and dictionaries are mutable.
- Immutable objects cannot be changed after creation, while mutable objects can be modified in-place.
- Modifying an immutable object creates a new object, while mutable objects can be altered directly.

Understanding mutability is important when working with data structures in Python, as it affects how you can manipulate and interact with objects.

## <mark> 19) Why File handling useful in python ? Explain any one of file handling functions with appropriate python script.(Create,Read, Write ,Open,close) </mark>

### Importance of File Handling in Python

File handling is a crucial aspect of programming that allows you to read from and write to files. It is essential for various applications, such as data processing, logging, configuration management, and more. Python provides built-in functions and methods to handle files efficiently. Here are some reasons why file handling is useful:

1. **Data Persistence**: File handling allows you to store data permanently, so it can be accessed later even after the program has ended.
2. **Data Sharing**: Files can be easily shared between different programs or users.
3. **Configuration Management**: Many applications use configuration files to store settings that can be modified without changing the code.
4. **Logging**: Applications can log events or errors to a file for debugging and auditing purposes.

#### File Handling Functions in Python

Python provides several built-in functions for file handling, including:

- **`open()`**: Opens a file and returns a file object.
- **`read()`**: Reads the contents of a file.
- **`write()`**: Writes data to a file.
- **`close()`**: Closes the file.

#### Example: File Handling in Python

Let's demonstrate file handling by creating a simple Python script that creates a file, writes some text to it, reads the content back, and then closes the file.

#### Step-by-Step Example:

1. **Create a File and Write Data**:

```python
## Open a file for writing
file = open("example.txt", "w")  ## 'w' mode creates the file if it doesn't exist

## Write data to the file
file.write("Hello, World!\\n")
file.write("This is an example of file handling in Python.\\n")

## Close the file
file.close()

```

1. **Read Data from the File**:

```python
## Open the file for reading
file = open("example.txt", "r")  ## 'r' mode opens the file for reading

## Read the contents of the file
content = file.read()
print("File Content:\\n", content)

## Close the file
file.close()

```

#### Complete Script Example:

Hereâ€™s how both parts come together in one complete script:

```python
## Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:  ## Using 'with' ensures proper closure of the file
    file.write("Hello, World!\\n")
    file.write("This is an example of file handling in Python.\\n")

## Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("File Content:\\n", content)

```

#### Explanation:

- **Creating and Writing**:
  - The `open()` function is used with mode `'w'` to create (or overwrite) a text file named `example.txt`.
  - The `write()` method writes strings to the file.
  - The `close()` method is called to ensure that all data is flushed and resources are released.
- **Reading**:
  - The `open()` function is used again with mode `'r'` to read from the existing `example.txt`.
  - The `read()` method retrieves all content from the file.
  - Again, using `close()` ensures proper resource management.
- **Using `with` Statement**: The `with` statement simplifies exception handling by encapsulating common preparation and cleanup tasks. It automatically closes the file when exiting the block.

#### Conclusion

File handling in Python is essential for managing data persistence, sharing information between applications, and maintaining configurations. Understanding how to create, read, write, and close files allows developers to build robust applications that interact with external data sources effectively.

## <mark> 20) Explain various file handling modes with examples. </mark>

### File Handling Modes in Python

Python provides several modes for opening and handling files. The mode is specified as an optional argument in the `open()` function. Here are the most commonly used file handling modes:

1. **`'r'`** (read mode): This is the default mode. It opens the file for reading. If the file does not exist, it raises a `FileNotFoundError`.

```python
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
content = file.read()
print(content)
file.close()

```

1. **`'w'`** (write mode): This mode opens the file for writing. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file. If the file exists, it overwrites the existing content.

```python
file = open('example.txt', 'w')
file.write('Hello, World!')
file.close()

```

1. **`'a'`** (append mode): This mode opens the file for appending. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file. If the file exists, it appends the new content to the end of the file.

```python
file = open('example.txt', 'a')
file.write('\\nAppending new line.')
file.close()

```

1. **`'x'`** (exclusive creation mode): This mode opens the file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, it raises a `FileExistsError`.

```python
try:
    file = open('example.txt', 'x')
    file.write('Creating a new file.')
except FileExistsError:
    print('File already exists.')

```

1. **`'b'`** (binary mode): This mode is used for handling binary files, such as images, audio, or video files. It can be combined with other modes like `'rb'` (read binary), `'wb'` (write binary), or `'ab'` (append binary).

```python
with open('image.jpg', 'rb') as file:
    content = file.read()

```

1. **`'t'`** (text mode): This is the default mode for text files. It can be combined with other modes like `'rt'` (read text), `'wt'` (write text), or `'at'` (append text).

```python
with open('example.txt', 'rt') as file:
    content = file.read()

```

1. **`'+'`** (read-write mode): This mode allows both reading and writing to the file. It can be combined with other modes like `'r+'` (read and write), `'w+'` (write and read), or `'a+'` (append and read).

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r+') as file:
    file.write('Overwriting content.')
    file.seek(0)
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

```

It's important to note that when you're done with a file, you should close it using the `close()` method or use the `with` statement, which automatically takes care of closing the file for you.

The `with` statement is a convenient way to handle file operations. It ensures that the file is properly closed, even if an exception occurs within the block.

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

```

Understanding file handling modes is crucial when working with files in Python. Choose the appropriate mode based on your specific requirements, such as reading, writing, appending, or handling binary data.

## <mark> 21) How can a function be passed as an object in python? Explain with examples. </mark>

In Python, functions are first-class objects, meaning they can be passed around as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables. This allows for a high level of flexibility in programming. You can pass a function as an object to another function, enabling you to create higher-order functions.

#### Passing Functions as Objects

When you pass a function as an argument to another function, you can execute it within that function or use it in some way. This is commonly used in callbacks, decorators, and functional programming paradigms.

#### Example: Passing Functions as Arguments

Let's look at an example where we define a simple function that takes another function as an argument and applies it to a list of numbers.

```python
def apply_function(func, numbers):
    """Applies the given function to each item in the list."""
    return [func(num) for num in numbers]

## Define a couple of simple functions
def square(x):
    return x * x

def cube(x):
    return x * x * x

## List of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

## Pass the square function
squared_numbers = apply_function(square, numbers)
print("Squared Numbers:", squared_numbers)  ## Output: Squared Numbers: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

## Pass the cube function
cubed_numbers = apply_function(cube, numbers)
print("Cubed Numbers:", cubed_numbers)  ## Output: Cubed Numbers: [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]

```

#### Explanation:

1. **`apply_function`**: This is a higher-order function that takes another function (`func`) and a list of numbers (`numbers`) as arguments. It applies the passed function to each number in the list using a list comprehension.
2. **`square` and `cube`**: These are two simple functions that compute the square and cube of a number respectively.
3. **Function Calls**: We call `apply_function` with `square` and `cube`, passing the list of numbers. The results are printed out.

#### Example: Using Functions as Callbacks

You can also use functions as callbacks. Hereâ€™s an example with sorting:

```python
def sort_with_custom_key(numbers, key_func):
    """Sorts numbers using a custom key function."""
    return sorted(numbers, key=key_func)

## Define a key function
def absolute_value(x):
    return abs(x)

## List of numbers
numbers = [-5, -1, -3, 2, 4]

## Sort using absolute values
sorted_numbers = sort_with_custom_key(numbers, absolute_value)
print("Sorted by Absolute Value:", sorted_numbers)  ## Output: Sorted by Absolute Value: [-1, 2, -3, 4, -5]

```

#### Explanation:

1. **`sort_with_custom_key`**: This function sorts a list of numbers based on a custom key function provided as an argument.
2. **`absolute_value`**: This is the key function that returns the absolute value of a number.
3. **Sorting**: We call `sort_with_custom_key`, passing the list of numbers and the `absolute_value` function to sort the numbers by their absolute values.

#### Conclusion

In Python, functions can be treated like any other object. You can pass them as arguments to other functions or return them from functions. This capability allows for powerful programming techniques such as callbacks and higher-order functions. Understanding how to work with functions as objects is essential for writing flexible and reusable code in Python.

## <mark> 22) Explain the importance of higher order functions in python. </mark>

### Importance of Higher-Order Functions in Python

Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments, return them as results, or both. This feature is a powerful aspect of Python and functional programming that enhances code flexibility and reusability. Here are some key reasons why higher-order functions are important:

#### 1. **Code Reusability**

Higher-order functions allow you to write generic code that can be reused with different functions. This reduces code duplication and makes your programs more modular.

#### 2. **Abstraction**

They enable abstraction by allowing you to define operations without specifying the exact details of the function being used. This leads to cleaner and more understandable code.

#### 3. **Functional Programming Techniques**

Higher-order functions facilitate functional programming techniques such as mapping, filtering, and reducing data structures, making it easier to work with collections of data.

#### 4. **Callbacks**

They allow for the use of callbacks, which are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions. This is particularly useful in asynchronous programming and event handling.

#### Examples of Higher-Order Functions

Let's explore some examples to illustrate the concept of higher-order functions in Python.

#### Example 1: Using `map()`

The `map()` function applies a given function to all items in an iterable (like a list) and returns a map object (which can be converted to a list).

```python
def square(x):
    return x * x

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = list(map(square, numbers))
print("Squared Numbers:", squared_numbers)  ## Output: Squared Numbers: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

```

#### Example 2: Using `filter()`

The `filter()` function constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true.

```python
def is_even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_numbers = list(filter(is_even, numbers))
print("Even Numbers:", even_numbers)  ## Output: Even Numbers: [2, 4]

```

#### Example 3: Using `reduce()`

The `reduce()` function from the `functools` module applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in a list.

```python
from functools import reduce

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
sum_result = reduce(add, numbers)
print("Sum:", sum_result)  ## Output: Sum: 10

```

#### Example 4: Custom Higher-Order Function

You can create your own higher-order functions that accept other functions as parameters.

```python
def apply_function(func, value):
    return func(value)

def double(x):
    return x * 2

result = apply_function(double, 5)
print("Double of 5 is:", result)  ## Output: Double of 5 is: 10

```

#### Conclusion

Higher-order functions are a powerful feature in Python that allows for more flexible and reusable code. They enable you to pass functions as arguments and return them from other functions, facilitating various programming paradigms such as functional programming. By leveraging higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and custom-defined functions, you can create cleaner and more efficient code structures that enhance the overall design of your applications.

## <mark> 23) Explain following terms in python with suitable python example.(1) lambda (2) map (3) filter (4) reduce 5)Zip-unzip 6) Enumerate </mark>

In Python, several functional programming concepts can enhance the way you write and organize your code. Hereâ€™s an explanation of the following terms, along with suitable examples for each: **lambda**, **map**, **filter**, **reduce**, **zip/unzip**, and **enumerate**.

#### 1. Lambda

A **lambda** function is a small anonymous function defined using the `lambda` keyword. It can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. Lambda functions are often used for short, throwaway functions.

#### Example:

```python
## A simple lambda function to add two numbers
add = lambda x, y: x + y

result = add(5, 3)
print("Sum:", result)  ## Output: Sum: 8

```

#### 2. Map

The **map()** function applies a given function to all items in an iterable (like a list) and returns a map object (which can be converted to a list).

#### Example:

```python
## Using map to square each number in a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))

print("Squared Numbers:", squared_numbers)  ## Output: Squared Numbers: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

```

#### 3. Filter

The **filter()** function constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true.

#### Example:

```python
## Using filter to get even numbers from a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))

print("Even Numbers:", even_numbers)  ## Output: Even Numbers: [2, 4]

```

#### 4. Reduce

The **reduce()** function from the `functools` module applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in a list. It reduces the iterable to a single cumulative value.

#### Example:

```python
from functools import reduce

## Using reduce to calculate the product of all numbers in a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers)

print("Product:", product)  ## Output: Product: 24

```

#### 5. Zip and Unzip

The **zip()** function takes iterables (like lists) and aggregates them into tuples. It effectively "zips" together elements from multiple iterables.

#### Example of Zip:

```python
## Zipping two lists together
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
scores = [85, 90, 95]

zipped = list(zip(names, scores))
print("Zipped List:", zipped)
## Output: Zipped List: [('Alice', 85), ('Bob', 90), ('Charlie', 95)]

```

#### Example of Unzip:

You can unzip using the `zip()` function again with unpacking.

```python
## Unzipping the zipped list
unzipped_names, unzipped_scores = zip(*zipped)
print("Names:", unzipped_names)        ## Output: Names: ('Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie')
print("Scores:", unzipped_scores)      ## Output: Scores: (85, 90, 95)

```

#### 6. Enumerate

The **enumerate()** function adds a counter to an iterable and returns it as an enumerate object. This is useful when you need both the index and the value from a list.

#### Example:

```python
## Using enumerate to get index and value from a list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"Index {index}: {fruit}")

```

**Output:**

```
Index 0: apple
Index 1: banana
Index 2: cherry

```

#### Conclusion

These functional programming conceptsâ€”**lambda**, **map**, **filter**, **reduce**, **zip/unzip**, and **enumerate**â€”enhance Python's capabilities for writing concise and expressive code. They allow for more functional programming styles and make it easier to work with collections of data efficiently. Understanding these concepts will help you write cleaner and more maintainable code in Python.

## <mark> 24) Is lambda a higher order function? Explain how lambda function is useful in higher order functions? </mark>

Yes, lambda functions in Python are considered higher-order functions. A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument, returns a function, or both.

Lambda functions are anonymous functions, meaning they are defined without a name. They are typically used when you need a simple function for a short period of time, and you don't want to define a separate named function.

Here's how lambda functions are useful in higher-order functions:

1. **Passing lambda functions as arguments**:
   You can pass a lambda function as an argument to another function. This is particularly useful when you need a simple function as a callback or a predicate.

Example:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers))
print(doubled_numbers)  ## Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

```

In this example, `map()` is a higher-order function that takes a function and an iterable as arguments. We pass a lambda function `lambda x: x * 2` to `map()` to double each element in the `numbers` list.

1. **Returning lambda functions from functions**:
   A higher-order function can return a lambda function. This is useful when you want to create a function factory or a closure.

Example:

```python
def make_multiplier(n):
    return lambda x: x * n

triple = make_multiplier(3)
print(triple(5))  ## Output: 15

```

In this example, `make_multiplier()` is a higher-order function that returns a lambda function. The returned lambda function captures the value of `n` from the enclosing scope, creating a closure.

1. **Using lambda functions with other higher-order functions**:
   Lambda functions are often used with other higher-order functions like `filter()`, `reduce()`, and list comprehensions.

Example:

```python
from functools import reduce

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers)
print(product)  ## Output: 120

```

In this example, `reduce()` is a higher-order function that takes a function and an iterable as arguments. We pass a lambda function `lambda x, y: x * y` to `reduce()` to calculate the product of all elements in the `numbers` list.

Lambda functions are concise and convenient when you need a simple function for a short period of time. They are particularly useful in higher-order functions, where you can pass them as arguments, return them from functions, or use them with other higher-order functions to create more expressive and readable code.

## <mark> 25) Write the difference between </mark>

i) Map and Filter ii) set and frozen set

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the differences between **map** and **filter**, as well as **set** and **frozenset** in Python.

#### i) Map vs. Filter

**Map** and **filter** are both higher-order functions that operate on iterables, but they serve different purposes.

#### Map

- **Purpose**: The `map()` function applies a specified function to every item of an iterable (like a list) and returns a map object (which can be converted to a list).
- **Usage**: It is used when you want to transform the items in an iterable.

**Example of `map()`**:

```python
## Define a function to square numbers
def square(x):
    return x * x

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = list(map(square, numbers))
print("Squared Numbers:", squared_numbers)  ## Output: Squared Numbers: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

```

#### Filter

- **Purpose**: The `filter()` function constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a specified function returns true.
- **Usage**: It is used when you want to filter out elements from an iterable based on a condition.

**Example of `filter()`**:

```python
## Define a function to check if a number is even
def is_even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_numbers = list(filter(is_even, numbers))
print("Even Numbers:", even_numbers)  ## Output: Even Numbers: [2, 4]

```

#### Summary of Differences between Map and Filter

| Feature       | Map                                             | Filter                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose       | Transforms items in an iterable                 | Filters items based on a condition             |
| Output        | Returns transformed items                       | Returns items that satisfy the condition       |
| Function Type | Takes a function that transforms data           | Takes a function that returns boolean          |
| Result Type   | Returns a map object (can be converted to list) | Returns an iterator (can be converted to list) |

---

#### ii) Set vs. Frozenset

Both `set` and `frozenset` are built-in data types in Python that represent collections of unique elements. However, they differ in mutability.

#### Set

- **Mutability**: A `set` is mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements after it has been created.
- **Usage**: It is used when you need a collection of unique items and require the ability to modify the collection.

**Example of `set`**:

```python
## Create a set
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
print("Original Set:", my_set)  ## Output: Original Set: {1, 2, 3}

## Add an element
my_set.add(4)
print("Set after adding an element:", my_set)  ## Output: Set after adding an element: {1, 2, 3, 4}

## Remove an element
my_set.remove(2)
print("Set after removing an element:", my_set)  ## Output: Set after removing an element: {1, 3, 4}

```

#### Frozenset

- **Mutability**: A `frozenset` is immutable. Once it is created, you cannot add or remove elements.
- **Usage**: It is used when you need a collection of unique items but do not want the collection to change.

**Example of `frozenset`**:

```python
## Create a frozenset
my_frozenset = frozenset([1, 2, 3])
print("Frozenset:", my_frozenset)  ## Output: Frozenset: frozenset({1, 2, 3})

## Attempting to add or remove elements will raise an error
## my_frozenset.add(4)   ## This will raise AttributeError
## my_frozenset.remove(1) ## This will raise AttributeError

```

#### Summary of Differences between Set and Frozenset

| Feature    | Set                                                   | Frozenset                                        |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Mutability | Mutable                                               | Immutable                                        |
| Syntax     | `{}` or `set()`                                       | `frozenset()`                                    |
| Methods    | Supports methods like `.add()`, `.remove()`, etc.     | Does not support methods that modify the set     |
| Use Cases  | When you need a modifiable collection of unique items | When you need a fixed collection of unique items |

These differences highlight how `map` and `filter` serve distinct roles in functional programming while `set` and `frozenset` provide options for mutable and immutable collections in Python.
